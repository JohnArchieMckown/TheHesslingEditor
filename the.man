                           THE - The Hessling Editor
                                 Version 3.2
     
     ========================================================================
     INTRODUCTION
     ========================================================================
     
     THE is a text editor that uses both command line commands and key bindings
     to operate. It is intended to be similar to the VM/CMS System Product
     Editor, XEDIT and to KEDIT from Mansfield Software.
     
     THE was originally written to be used by people already familiar with the
     above editors. For this reason, this document provides limited information
     on using THE, and concentrates more on reference material, such as command
     syntax and configuration.

     ========================================================================
     THE BASICS
     ========================================================================
     
     The default screen displayed when THE starts consists of several areas:
     
     - a window which displays the contents of the file being editted. This is
       the <filearea>,
     - a <command line> from which commands may be issued,
     - a <prefix area> which shows line numbers and from which prefix commands
       can be issued
     - an <idline> which displays the file name, row/col etc. for the current
       file and
     - a <status line> which indicates global status info like number of files
       being editted, time etc.
     
     When THE starts, the cursor is positioned on the <command line>. To move
     between the <command line> and the <filearea>, the <CURSOR> HOME command is
     used. By default this command is bound to the HOME key (under DOS and OS/2),
     the DO key (on vt220s) and HOME (on xterms).
     
     To execute commands from the <command line> simply type the command and
     press the ENTER (or RETURN) key.
     
     To determine what keys are bound to what commands, execute the <SHOWKEY>
     command from the <command line>. As you press each key, THE will respond
     with the name of the key and any commands bound to that key.  To exit from
     the <SHOWKEY> command, press the spacebar.
     
     Key bindings may be changed for the current session by using the <DEFINE>
     command.  To keep key bindings between sessions, the <DEFINE> commands can
     be placed in a <profile> file, which is executed each time THE starts. For
     more information on this, see the next section; PROFILE FILE.
     
     It is possible to make THE look and behave more like either XEDIT or KEDIT.
     See the <SET COMPAT> command for further information.
     
     As mentioned before, this document provides little tutorial information. For
     those users who have a <REXX> enabled version of THE, a self-running
     demonstration <macro> is supplied which will provide a better explanation of
     the capabilities of THE, than any documentation could.  To run this demonstration,
     start THE as follows:
     
          +------------------------------
          the -p demo.the demo.txt
          +------------------------------
     
     ========================================================================
     COMMAND-LINE SWITCHES
     ========================================================================
     
     THE recognises many command-line switches when starting THE.  All switches are
     specified with a single '-' followed by a single character. The case of this
     character is relevant. Some switches take extra parameters; those that take
     optional extra parameters are indicated by the extra parameter being stated
     below in '[]'. The purpose of each of the switches is as follows:
     
     - -n Run THE without any profile. Normally THE tries to find a profile
       file and execute this on startup. This switch suppresses that search
       and execute and runs THE in its default mode. This switch is useful for
       determining if a bug in THE occurs only with certain user-specific
       customisations.
     - -m On ports of THE that support colour, this switch forces THE into
       monochrome mode. More a testing feature than a user feature.
     - -r This switch enabls THE to be run in readonly mode.  In this mode
       commands that alter the contents of a file are invalid.
     - -s On Unix platforms, this switch enables the writing of a core file if
       THE crashes.  Normally, THE traps any internal errors and exits gracefully.
       This switch is a testing feature rather than a user feature.
     - -b When you want to use THE as a non-interactive tool for manipulating
       the contents of one or more files, this switch will disable any display
       of file contents and disable keybord interaction. Normally used in
       conjunction with a specific profile; see -p option.
     - -q Run quietly in batch mode. This will suppress the introductory
       informative message displayed when errors are encountered running in batch.
     - -k[fmt]  Allows 'soft label keys'. This allows the display of one (or two)
       lines at the bottom of the screen with 'buttons' intended to be used to
       represent function keys. These 'soft label keys' can be manipulated with
       the <SET SLK> command.  The 'fmt' optional extra argument is a single digit
       representing the format of the display of the 'buttons'.
       o 1 - displays 8 'buttons' in a 4-4 layout
       o 2 - displays 8 'buttons' in a 3-2-3 layout
       o 3 - displays 12 'buttons' in a 4-4-4 layout
       o 4 - displays 12 'buttons' in a 4-4-4 layout with an index line
       o 5 - displays 10 'buttons' in a 5-5 layout
       Not all platforms support all 5 format options.
       On those ports of THE that are mouse-aware, the mouse can be pressed
       on a 'button', and the command assigned the the coresponding function
       key is executed.
     - -l line This switch specifies the line number to make current when THE
       starts.
     - -c col This switch specifies the column number to make current when THE
       starts.
     - -p profile Specifies the THE profile to run instead of the default
       profile. See next section for further details.
     - -a profile_arg Specifies the arguments that are passed to the profile
       specified with the -p switch.
     - -w width Specifies the maximum line width for a line in the current
       edit session. Can be overridded with the <SET WIDTH> command.
     - -u display_width THE can run as a binary editor. Specifying this switch
       tells THE to read in the file and display it in 'lines' that are
       'display_width' long.  All end-of-line characters in the file are
       ignored and are treated as other characters in the file.
     - -X X11_switches With the X11 port of THE, standard X11 switches can be
       specified with this switch to dynamically configure the way THE displays
       or behaves.  You can also specify XCurses-specific switches here as well.
       For more information on the XCurses switches available, consult the
       PDCurses documentation.
     - -1[dir] Tells THE to run in 'Single Instance Mode'. The first time THE is run with
       the -1 switch, it starts as normal. Subsequent executions of THE with the same -1
       command-line switch will not start a new instance of THE, rather it will edit
       the file(s) specified on the command-line in the currently running instance
       of THE.  You can optionally supply a directory with the -1 switch to specify where
       the THE FIFO (.thefifo) is created. If not supplied, the THE FIFO is created
       in the users $HOME directory.
       This feature is available with the X11 port of the using XCurses
       2.5 and greater, the ncurses port and with Windows ports.
       If the first instance of THE with the -1 switch crashes for any reason, subsequent
       attempts to run THE with the same -1 switch will hang.  To fix this remove the FIFO
       and then run THE with the -1 switch again.
     
     After all the above switches are stated on the command line, THE treats
     the remainder of the command line as files or directories to edit.
     
     ========================================================================
     PROFILE FILE
     ========================================================================
     
     Various session defaults may be changed on startup for an individual by
     using a <profile> file. This file contains various commands that set the
     current environment, including key bindings. This <profile> file can also be
     used to process commands in batch mode.
     
     THE will always try to execute a default profile unless specifically told not to
     with the -n command line switch. THE will look for an explicitly specified profile
     file and if this is not specified, THE will look for a default profile file as
     described below.
     
     A profile file can be explicitly specified and will be processed in the following
     order:
     - -p command line switch
     - THE_PROFILE_FILE environment variable
     If the profile file specified above does not exits, THE will exit with an error.
     
     If no explicit profile file is specified, THE will look for a default profile file
     as specified in Appendix 1 in the following order:
     - under Un*x type platforms; $HOME/.therc
     - under Un*x type platforms; file specified by --with-global-profile configure switch
       when built from source (if specified)
     - THE_HOME_DIR environment variable
     - the current directory
     
     Appendix 1 defines the name of the default profile on different platforms.
     
     An example of a profile might be to change all occurrences of 'alligator'
     to 'crocodile' in the file 'file.ext' in batch mode, a <profile> file;
     'prf.prf' with the following commands would be used:
     
          +------------------------------
          'c/alligator/crocodile/ * *'
          'file'
          +------------------------------
     
     and the command
     
          +------------------------------
          the -b -p prf.prf file.ext
          +------------------------------
     
     would be issued.
     
     This changes the first string enclosed in delimiters (generally any
     non-alphabetic character not in the string itself) to
     the second string for every line (*) starting at the current line
     (0 initially) changing each occurrence on a line (*).
     
     Maybe you only want to change a string after the first line that contains
     the string 'donkey', but only change the second occurrence of that string.
     The profile commands would then be:
     
          +------------------------------
          '/donkey/'
          'c/alligator/crocodile/ * 1 2'
          'file'
          +------------------------------
     
     The change command uses a <target> specification as its first parameter
     after the string details. A <target> can be a number of lines, an absolute
     line number, BLANK, ALL or a string.
     
     Number of line targets consist of either a positive integer, for
     referencing lines toward the end of the file, negative for referencing
     toward the start of the file or '*', which is all the remaining lines in
     the file or '-*' which is all lines toward the start of the file.
     
     An absolute line number in the form of ':n' is the line number in a file,
     starting with line number 1.

     COMMAND
          all - select and display restricted set of lines
     
     SYNTAX
          ALL [rtarget]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The ALL command allows for the selective display, and editing
          (subject to <SET SCOPE>) of lines that match the specified target.
          This target consists of any number of individual targets
          separated by '&' (logical and) or '|' (logical or).
     
          For example, to display all lines in a file that contain the
          strings 'ball' and 'cat' on the same line or the named lines
          .fred or .bill, use the following command
     
          ALL /ball/ & /cat/ | .fred | .bill
     
          Logical operators act left to right, with no precedence for &.
     
          <rtarget> can also be specified as a regular expression. The syntax of
          this is "Regexp /re/". eg ALL R /[0-9].*$/
     
          ALL without any arguments, is the equivalent of setting the
          selection level of all lines in your file to 0 and running
          <SET DISPLAY> 0 0.

     DESCRIPTION
          The BACKWARD command scrolls the file contents backwards 'n' screens
          or 'n' lines if the optional 'Lines' argument is specified.
     
          If '*' is specified, the <Top-File line> becomes the <current line>.
     
          If 'HALF' is specified, the file contents are scrolled one half of a screen.
     
          If 0 is specified as the number of lines or screens to scroll, the last
          line of the file becomes the <current line>.
     
          If the BACKWARD command is issued while the current line is the
          <Top-of-File line> and <SET PAGEWRAP> is ON, the last line of the file becomes

          Change [/string1/string2/ [target] [n] [m]]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The CHANGE command changes one string of text to another.
     
          The first parameter to the change command is the old and new
          string values, separated by delimiters.
          The first non alphabetic character after the 'change' command
          is the delimiter.
     
          <'target'> specifies how many lines are to be searched for
          occurrences of 'string1' to be changed.
     
          'n' determines how many occurrences of 'string1' are to be
          changed to 'string2' on each line. 'n' may be specified as
          '*' which will result in all occurrences of 'string1' will
          be changed.  '*' is equivalent to the current WIDTH of the
          line.
     
          'm' determines from which occurrence of 'string1' on the line
          changes are to commence.
     
          If no arguments are supplied to the CHANGE command, the last
          change command, if any, is re-executed.

          The CINSERT command inserts 'text' starting at the column position.
     
          'text' can include leading or trailing space characters. Thus
          CINSERT immediately followed by 5 spaces, will insert 4 space

          CURsor Mouse [Priority priority]
          CURsor Prefix [Priority priority]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The CURSOR command allows the user to specify where the cursor
          is to be positioned.
     
          CURSOR 'Column' moves the cursor to the current column of the
          <focus line>.
     
          CURSOR 'Screen' 'UP'|'DOWN'|'LEFT'|'RIGHT' moves the cursor in the
          indicated direction one line or column. If the cursor is
          positioned on the first or last line of the screen, the cursor
          wraps to the first or last enterable line. If the cursor is
          positioned on the left or right edges of the screen, the cursor
          moves to the left or right edge of the screen on the same line.
     
          CURSOR 'Screen' 'row' ['col'] is similar to CURSOR 'Escreen'
          'row' ['col'], but all coordinates are relative the the top left
          corner of the screen, not the top left corner of the
          <filearea>. Hence, 1,1 would be an invalid cursor position because
          it would result in the cursor being moved to the <idline>.
          Specification of 'row' and/or 'col' outside the boundaries of the
          logical window is regarded as an error.
     
          CURSOR ['Escreen'] 'UP'|'DOWN'|'LEFT'|'RIGHT' is similar to CURSOR
          'Screen' 'UP'|'DOWN'|'LEFT'|'RIGHT', except that where scrolling
          of the window is possible, then scrolling will take place.
     
          CURSOR ['Escreen'] 'row' ['col'] moves the cursor to the specified
          'row'/'col' position within the <filearea>. The top left corner of
          the <filearea> is 1,1.
          'row' and 'col' may be specified as '=', which will default to the
          current row and/or column position.
          If 'row' or 'col' are greater than the maximum number of rows or
          columns in the <filearea>, the cursor will move to the last
          row/column available.
          If the specified 'row' is a <reserved line>, <scale line> or <tab line>
          an error will be displayed.
          If the 'row' specified is above the <Top-of-File line> or below the
          <Bottom-of-File line> the cursor will be placed on the closest
          one of these lines.
     
          CURSOR 'Kedit' 'LEFT'|'RIGHT' mimics the default behaviour of
          CURL and CURR in KEDIT.
     
          CURSOR 'CUA' 'UP'|'DOWN'|'LEFT'|'RIGHT' moves the cursor in the
          indicated direction one line or column. The behaviour of the
          cursor at the the end of a line and at the start of a line is
          consistent with the Common User Access (CUA) definition.
     
          CURSOR 'CMdline' moves the cursor to the indicated column of the
          <command line>.
     
          CURSOR 'HOME' moves the cursor to the first column of the <command line>
          (if not on the command line), or to the last row/column of
          the <filearea> if on the <command line>. With the ['SAVE'] option,
          the cursor will move to the last row/column of the <filearea> or
          <prefix area> (which ever was the last position) if on the
          <command line>.
     
          CURSOR 'File' moves the cursor to the line and column of the file.
          If the line and/or column are not currently displayed, an error
          message is displayed.
     
          CURSOR 'GOTO' moves the cursor to the specified line and column
          of the file, whether the row and column are currently displayed or
          not.  If the 'line' and 'col' are currently displayed, then this
          command behaves just like CURSOR 'File'. If not, then the
          <current line> will be changed to the specified <line>.
     
          CURSOR 'Mouse' moves the cursor to the position where a mouse button
          was last activated.  This command is specific to THE.
     
          CURSOR 'PREFIX' moves the cursor to the first column of the <prefix area>
          (if not in the prefix area), or to the first column of the <filearea> if
          in the <prefix area>. This command has no effect if run from the <command line>.
          This command replaces TABPRE.
     
          The optional 'Priority' argument is included for compatibility with XEDIT.
          The value of the 'priority' argument must be between 0 and 256, but otherwise
          it is ignored.

     DESCRIPTION
          The DEFINE command allows the user to assign one or many
          commands and optional parameter(s) to a key or a mouse button
          specification.
     
          Commands may be abbreviated.
     
          If multiple commands are assigned, then the LINEND setting
          must be ON and the LINEND character must match the character
          that delimits the commands at the time that the DEFINE command
          is executed. LINEND can be OFF at the time the key is pressed.
     
          With no arguments, any existing definition for that key is
          removed and the key reverts back to its default assignation (if
          it had any).
     
          'key-name' corresponds to the key name shown with the <SHOWKEY> command.
     
          If the optional keyword; 'REXX', is supplied, the remainder of the

     DESCRIPTION
          The DIALOG command displays a dialog box in the middle of the screen
          with user-configurable settings.
     
          The mandatory 'prompt' parameter is the text of a prompt displayed
          near the top of the dialog window. Up to 100 lines can be displayed
          by separating lines with a character (decimal 10).
     
          'EDITfield' creates a user enterable field, with a default value
          of 'val', if supplied. While the cursor is in the editfield, "normal"
          edit keys are in effect. See <READV> for more details on keys that are
          useable in the editfield.  The same keys that exit from the <READV>
          command also exit the editfield. On exit from the editfield, the
          first button becomes active.
     
          'title' specifies optional text to be displayed on the border of
          the dialog box.
     
          The type of button combination can be specifed as one of the following:
     
               OK - just an OK button is displayed
               OKCANCEL - an OK and a CANCEL button are displayed
               YESNO - a YES and a NO button are displayed
               YESNOCANCEL - a YES, a NO and a CANCEL button are displayed
     
          If no button combination is selected, an OK button is displayed.
     
          If 'DEFBUTTON' is specified, it indicates which of the buttons is to
          be set as the active button. This is a number between 1 and the
          number of buttons displayed. By default, button 1 is active. If
          'EDITfield' is specified, no active button is set.
     
          The active button can be selected by pressing the TAB key; to exit
          from the DIALOG, press the RETURN or ENTER key, or click the first
          mouse button on the required button.
     
          On exit from the DIALOG command, the following Rexx variables are set:
     
               DIALOG.0 - 2
               DIALOG.1 - value of 'EDITfield'
               DIALOG.2 - button selected as specified in the call to the command.
     
          The colours used for the dialog box are:
     
               Border          -  <SET COLOR> DIALOGBORDER
               Prompt area     -  <SET COLOR> DIALOG

     COMMAND
          editv - set and retrieve persistent macro variables
     
     SYNTAX
          EDITV GET|PUT|GETF|PUTF var1 [var2 ...]
          EDITV SET|SETF var1 value1 [var2 value2 ...]
          EDITV SETL|SETLF|SETFL var1 value1
          EDITV LIST|LISTF [var1 ...]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The EDITV command manipulates variables for the lifetime of the
          edit session or the file, depending on the subcommand used.
     
          Edit variables are useful for maintaining variable values from
          one execution of a macro to another.
     
          EDITV GET, PUT, GETF and PUTF are only valid from within a macro
          as they reference Rexx variables.  All other subcommands are valid
          from within a macro or from the command line.
     
          EDITV GET sets a Rexx macro variable, with the same name as the
          edit variable, to the value of the edit variable.
     
          EDITV PUT stores the value of a Rexx macro variable as an edit
          variable.
     
          EDITV SET stores an edit variable with a value.
     
          EDITV SET can only work with variable values comprising a single
          space-separated word.  To specify a variable value that contains
          spaces, use EDITV SETL.
     
          EDITV LIST displays the values of the specified edit variables, or
          all variables if no edit variables are specified.
     
          EDITV GETF, PUTF, SETF, SETLF, SETFL, and LISTF all work the same
          way as their counterparts without the F, but the variables are
          only available while the particular file is the current file.  This
          enables you to use the same edit variable name but with different
          values for different files.

     DESCRIPTION
          If the cursor is currently on the <command line>, the ENTER command
          executes the command currently displayed.
     
          If the cursor is in the <filearea>, the ENTER command results in
          a new line being added after the <focus line>, and the cursor
          placed on the next line depending on the value of <SET NEWLINES>.
          If <SET READONLY> is ON, then no new lines is added and the cursor
          is moved to the first column of the next line.
     
          If the cursor is in the <prefix area>, any pending prefix commands
          will be executed.
     
          With the optional 'CUA' argument, when in the <filearea>, the enter

     DESCRIPTION
          The MARK command marks a portion of text for later processing
          by a <COPY>, <MOVE> or <DELETE> command. This marked area is
          known as a <block>.
     
          When the MARK command is executed with the optional line/column
          arguments, these values are used to specify the position of the
          marked <block>.  Without the optional arguments, the position of
          the cursor is used to determine which portion of text is marked.
     
          'line1' and 'line2' specify the first or last line of the
          marked block.
     
          'col1' and 'col2' specify the first or last column of the
          marked block.
     
          Any currently marked block will be unmarked or extended depending on
          the arguments supplied.
     
          When marking a <word block>, 'line1' and 'col1' refer to any position
          within the word.

          specified by 'target1' to the line specified by 'target2' in the
          same file.
     
          The second form of the MOVE command moves the contents of the marked
          <block> to the current cursor position. If the optional ['RESET']
          argument is supplied, the marked block is reset as though a

     DESCRIPTION
          The POPUP command allows the user to create and display a popup
          menu containing a list of selectable options.
     
          The location of the popup menu is specified by the first parameter.
     
          'MOUSE' specifies that the top left corner of the popup menu is to
          be displayed where the mouse cursor currently is displayed. This option
          is only valid if the popup window is initiated from a macro assigned to
          a mouse event.
     
          'TEXT' specifies that the top left corner of the popup menu is to
          be displayed where the text cursor is displayed. If the text starts with
          a dash, then a divider line is inserted.
     
          'ABOVE' specifies that the bottom row of the popup window is to be displayed
          above the line where the text cursor is displayed.  The popup window will use at
          most from the line above the text cursor to the top of the screen.
     
          'BELOW' specifies that the top row of the popup window is to be displayed
          below the line where the text cursor is displayed.  The popup window will use at
          most from the line below the text cursor to the bottom of the screen.
     
          'CENTRE' or 'CENTER' specifies that the popup window is centred in the
          middle of the screen.  This option will use all of the screen to display the
          popup window if necessary.
     
          If the location is not specified, then the default is 'CENTRE'
     
          'INITIAL' specifies the item to be highlighted when the popup window
          is first displayed.  This value must be within the bounds of the items
          specified.
     
          'ESCAPE' specifies the keyname that can be used to quit from the popup
          window without making a selection.  By default 'q' will quit. Only keynames
          that are valid with the <DEFINE> command are allowed.
     
          'KEYS' specifies a list of keynames that can be used to exit from the popup
          with a selection. Only keynames that are valid with the <DEFINE> command are allowed.
          A maximum of 20 keynames can be specified.
     
          On return from the popup menu, the following Rexx variables are set:
     
               popup.0 = 4
               popup.1 = Item selected or empty string if no item selected.
               popup.2 = Item number selected or zero if no item selected.
               popup.3 = Item number on which the cursor was last positioned.
               popup.4 = The index into the list of 'KEYS' that terminated the popup or 0 if ENTER used.
     
          If mouse support is available, an item is selectable by clicking
          the first mouse button on the item.  To quit from the popup window
          without making a selection, click the mouse outside the popup
          window, or on the border of the window.
     
          Keyboard keys that take effect in the POPUP command are CURU, CURD,
          CURL, CURR, PGUP, PGDN and ENTER.
     
          The colours used for the popup are:
     
               Border           -  <SET COLOR> POPUPBORDER
               Non-current line -  <SET COLOR> POPUP

          readv - read keystrokes and pass to macro
     
     SYNTAX
          READV Cmdline [initial text]
          READV KEY
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The READV command allows a Rexx macro to interact with the user
          by accepting either individual keystrokes ('KEY') or a complete
          line of text ('Cmdline').
     
          The READV 'Cmdline' can take optional 'initial text' to be
          displayed on the command line.
     
          The 'macro' obtains the entered information by setting Rexx
          variables. These are set as follows.
     
          'KEY' option:
     
               readv.0 = 4
               readv.1 = name of key (empty if unknown)
               readv.2 = ASCII value of key (null if not an ASCII code)
               readv.3 = curses key value (or ASCII code if an ASCII code)
               readv.4 = shift status (see below)
     
          'CMDLINE' option:
     
               readv.0 = 1
               readv.1 = contents of command line
     
          While editing the command in READV 'Cmdline', any key redefinitions
          you have made will be in effect.  Therefore you can use your
          "normal" editing keys to edit the line.  THE will allow the
          following commands to be executed while in READV 'Cmdline':
     
               <CURSOR> LEFT, <CURSOR> RIGHT, <CURSOR> DOWN, <CURSOR> UP,
               <SOS FIRSTCHAR>, <SOS ENDCHAR>, <SOS STARTENDCHAR>,
               <SOS DELEND>, <SOS DELCHAR>, <SOS DELCHAR>,
               <SOS TABB>, <SOS TABF>, <SOS TABWORDB>, <SOS TABWORDF>,
               <SOS UNDO>, <SOS DELWORD>, <SET INSERTMODE>, <TEXT>
     
          Either of the keys, TAB, ENTER, RETURN and NUMENTER will terminate
          READV 'Cmdline', irrespective of what THE commands have been
          assigned.
     
          The shift status of the key is an eight character string of
          0 or 1; each position represented by the following.
     
               Position
                  1      1 if INSERTMODE is ON
                  2      always 0
                  3      always 0
                  4      always 0
                  5      1 if ALT key pressed
                  6      1 if CTRL key pressed
                  7      1 if SHIFT key pressed
                  8      same as position 7

          the specified number of times specified by <'target'>.
     
          To determine how many lines on which to execute the last command,
          THE uses the target to determine how many lines from the current
          position to the target.  This is the number of times the last
          command is executed.
     
          If the last command to be executed, changes the current line,
          (because it has a target specification), the next execution of
          the last command will begin from where the previous execution of

          already exists which will result in an error message being

     SYNTAX
          SCHange /string1/string2/ [target] [n] [m]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SCHANGE command changes one string of text to another only
          after confirming each individual change with the user.
     
          The first parameter to the change command is the old and new
          string values, separated by delimiters.
          The allowable delimiters are '/' '\' and '@'.
     
          The second parameter is the <target>; how many lines are to be
          searched for occurrences of 'string1' to be changed.
     
          'n' determines how many occurrences of 'string1' are to be
          changed to 'string2' on each line.
     
          'm' determines from which occurrence of 'string1' on the line
          changes are to commence.

     COMMAND
          search - locate a string
     
     SYNTAX
          SEArch string target
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SEARCH command searches for the next or previous occurrence
          of the specified <'string target'>.  If no parameter is supplied,
          SEARCH uses the the last target specified. If no prior target has been
          specified, an error message is displayed.
     
          The SEARCH command is similar to the <LOCATE> command, but it
          only locates strings or regular expressions. The advantage of SEARCH
          over LOCATE is that targets are searched from the current <focus line>
          and <focus column> and if the found target is not currently in view,
          it will change the view to make the target visible. This behaviour is
          more compatible with other editors than the behaviour of <LOCATE>.
     
          When searching backwards, not only is the search done from the <focus line>
          to the end of file, but the searching within a line is done from right to left.
     
          <string target> can also be specified as a regular expression. The syntax of
          this is "Regexp /re/". eg SEARCH RE /[0-9].*$/

     SYNTAX
          SORT target [[sort field 1] [...] [sort field 1000]]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SORT command sorts a portion of a file based on the 'sort field'
          specifications.
     
          A 'sort field' specification consists of:
     
               order flag   - [Ascending|Descending]
               left column  - left column of field to sort on
               right column - right column of field to sort on
     
          If the 'order flag' is omitted for a 'sort field', the 'order flag' for
          the previous 'sort field' is used. If no 'order flag' is specified, all
          sort fields are sorted in acending order. Therefore
          SORT * D 1 1 2 2 A 3 3 4 4 is the same as SORT * D 1 1 D 2 2 A 3 3 A 4 4
     
          The right column MUST be >= left column.
     
          1000 sort fields are allowed.
     
          <'target'> can be any valid target including ALL, *, -*, and BLOCK.

          tag - displays lines matching target in different colour
     
     SYNTAX
          TAG [More|Less] [rtarget|Focus]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The TAG command is similar to the <ALL> command, in that it allows
          lines that match the specified target to be displayed.  Where it
          differs from <ALL> is that the lines that don't match are still
          displayed, but the lines that do match are displayed in the colour
          specified by <SET COLOUR> HIGHLIGHT.
          This target consists of any number of individual targets
          separated by '&' (logical and) or '|' (logical or).
     
          For example, to display all lines in a file that contain the
          strings 'ball' and 'cat' on the same line or the named lines
          .fred or .bill, use the following command
     
          TAG /ball/ & /cat/ | .fred | .bill
     
          Logical operators act left to right, with no precedence for &.
     
          TAG without any arguments displays all lines without any highlighting.
     
          If <SET HIGHLIGHT> is not set to TAGGED, then if the specified 'rtarget'
          is found, <SET HIGHLIGHT> is set to TAGGED.
     
          When the optional 'More' argument is specified, all lines that match
          the 'rtarget' are highlighted in addition to those already highlighted.
     
          When the optional 'Less' argument is specified, all lines that match
          the 'rtarget' and are currently highlighted have their highlighting
          removed.
     
          If 'FOCUS' is specified in place of 'rtarget', the <focus line> is
          tagged.

     SYNTAX
          [SET] AUTOCOLOR mask parser [MAGIC]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SET AUTOCOLOR command allows the user to specify which syntax
          highlighting <parser> is to be used for which file masks.
     
          The 'parser' argument specifies a syntax highlighting <parser> that
          already exists, either as a default <parser>, or added by the user
          with <SET PARSER>.  The special parser name of '*NULL' can be
          specified; this will effectively remove the association between
          the <parser> and the file mask.
     
          The 'mask' argument specifies the file mask (or <magic number>) to
          associate with the specified parser.  The 'mask' can be any valid
          file mask for the operating system. eg *.c fred.* joe.?
     
          If the 'magic' option is specified, the 'mask' argument refers to
          the last element of the <magic number> that is specified in the
          first line of a Unix shell script comment. eg if the first line of
          a shell script contains:
          #!/usr/local/bin/rexx
          then the file mask argument would be specified as "rexx".

     DESCRIPTION
          The SET AUTOSAVE command sets the interval between automatic saves
          of the file, or turns it off altogether.  The interval 'n' refers
          to the number of alterations made to the file.  Hence a value of
          10 for 'n' would result in the file being automatically saved after
          each 10 alterations have been made to the file.
     
          It is not possible to set AUTOSAVE for 'pseudo' files such as the
          directory listing 'file', Rexx output 'file' and the key definitions

     DESCRIPTION
          The SET AUTOSCROLL allows the user to set the rate at which automatic
          horizontal scrolling occurs.
     
          When the cursor reaches the last (or first) column of the <filearea>
          the <filearea> can automatically scroll if AUTOSCROLL is not 'OFF' and
          a <CURSOR> RIGHT or <CURSOR> LEFT command is issued.
          How many columns are scrolled is determined by the setting of AUTOSCROLL.
     
          If AUTOSCROLL is set to 'HALF', then half the number of columns in the
          <filearea> window are scrolled.  Any other value will result in that
          many columns scrolled, or the full width of the <filearea> window if
          the set number of columns is larger.
     
          Autoscrolling does not occur if the key pressed is assigned to
          <CURSOR> SCREEN LEFT or RIGHT, which is the case if <SET COMPAT> XEDIT

     SYNTAX
          [SET] BACKup OFF|TEMP|KEEP|ON|INPLACE [suffix]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SET BACKUP command allows the user to determine if a backup copy
          of the original file is to be kept when the file being edited is
          saved or filed.
     
          'KEEP' and 'ON' options are the same. 'ON' is
          kept for compatibility with previous versions of THE.
     
          With 'OFF', the file being written to disk will replace an
          existing file. There is a chance that you will end up with neither
          the old version of the file or the new one if problems occur
          while the file is being written.
     
          With 'TEMP' or 'KEEP' options, the file being written is first
          renamed to the filename with a .bak extension. The file in memory
          is then written to disk. If 'TEMP' is in effect, the backup
          file is then deleted.
     
          With 'INPLACE', the file being written is first copied to a file
          with a .bak extension. The file in memory is then written to disk
          in place of the original.  This option ensures that all operating
          system file attributes are retained.
     
          The optional 'suffix' specifies the string to append to the file name
          of the backup copy including a period if required. The maximum length
          of 'suffix' is 100 characters.
          By default this is ".bak".

          This command only has a visible effect on GUI platforms, currently

          [SET] CASE Mixed|Lower|Upper [Respect|Ignore] [Respect|Ignore] [Respect|Ignore] [Mixed|Lower|Upper] [Mixed|Lower|Upper]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The CASE command sets the editor's handling of the case of text.
     
          The first option (which is mandatory) controls how text is entered
          by the user in the <filearea>. When 'LOWER' or 'UPPER' are in effect,
          the shift or caps lock keys have no effect on the text being entered.
          When 'MIXED' is in effect, text is entered in the case set by the use
          of the shift and caps lock keys.
     
          The second option determines how the editor determines if a string
          target matches text in the file when the target is used in a <LOCATE>
          command.  With 'IGNORE' in effect, a match is
          found irrespective of the case of the target or the found text.
          The following strings are treated as equivalent: the THE The ThE...
          With 'RESPECT' in effect, the target and text must be the same case.
          Therefore a target of 'The' only matches text containing 'The', not
          'THE' or 'ThE' etc.
     
          The third option determines how the editor determines if a string
          target matches text in the file when the target is used in a <CHANGE>
          command.  With 'IGNORE' in effect, a match is
          found irrespective of the case of the target or the found text.
          The following strings are treated as equivalent: the THE The ThE...
          With 'RESPECT' in effect, the target and text must be the same case.
          Therefore a target of 'The' only matches text containing 'The', not
          'THE' or 'ThE' etc.
     
          The fourth option determines how the editor determines the sort
          order of upper and lower case with the <SORT> command.
          With 'IGNORE' in effect, upper and lower case letters are treated as
          equivalent.
          With 'RESPECT' in effect, upper and lower case letters are treated as
          different values and uppercase characters will sort before lowercase
          characters.
     
          The fifth option controls how text is entered by the user on the
          <command line>. The allowed values and behaviour are the same as for
          the first option.
     
          The sixth option controls how text is entered by the user in the
          <prefix area>. The allowed values and behaviour are the same as for
          the first option.
     
          All options can be specified as the current EQUIVCHAR to retain the
          existing value.

     DESCRIPTION
          The SET CLEARERRORKEY command allows the user to specify which
          key clears the message line.  By default, any key pressed will
          cause the message line to be cleared.  The keyname specified
          is the name returned via the <SHOWKEY> command.
     
          As the <QUERY> command also uses the same mechanism for displaying
          its results as errors, then this command affects when results from
          the <QUERY> command are cleared.

          The third format of this command allows the user to change the intensity
          of specified colors on platforms that support changing the content of a
          color (X11, Windows GUI).  The specified color can be changed by supplying
          the intensity of red, green and blue. These are numeric values between 0
          and 1000 inclusive.  eg To change 'red' to 'blue': SET COLOR RED 0 0 1000.
          All characters being displayed as 'red' will be displayed with the specified
          intensities. Note that this behaviour is not consistent across platforms, and
          should be considered experimental at this stage.
     
          It is an error to attempt to set a colour on a mono display.

     DESCRIPTION
          The SET COMPAT command changes some settings of THE to make it
          more compatible with the look and/or feel of XEDIT, KEDIT,
          KEDIT for Windows, or ISPF.
     
          This command is most useful as the first <SET> command in a
          profile file. It will change the default settings of THE to
          initially look and behave like the chosen editor. You can then
          make any additional changes in THE by issuing other <SET> commands.
     
          It is recommended that this command NOT be executed from the
          command line, particularly if you have 2 files being displayed
          at the same time.  Although the command works, things may look
          and behave strangely :-)
     
          The first parameter affects the look of THE, the second parameter
          affects the feel of THE, and the third parameter determines
          which default function key settings you require.
     
          Any of the parameters can be specified as =, which will not
          change that aspect of THE's compatibility.

     SYNTAX
          [SET] CURLine [ON] M[+n|-n] | [+|-]n
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SET CURLINE command sets the position of the <current line> to
          the physical screen line specified by supplied arguments.
     
          The first form of parameters is:
     
          M[+n|-n]
          this sets the <current line> to be relative to the middle of
          the screen. A positive value adds to the middle line number,
          a negative subtracts from it.
          e.g. M+3 on a 24 line screen will be line 15
              M-5 on a 24 line screen will be line 7
     
          The second form of parameters is:
     
          [+|-]n
          this sets the <current line> to be relative to the top of the
          screen (if positive or no sign) or relative to the bottom
          of the screen if negative.
          e.g. +3 or 3 will set current line to line 3
              -3 on a 24 line screen will be line 21
     
          If the resulting line is outside the bounds of the screen
          the position of the current line will become the middle line
          on the screen.
     
          It is optional to specify the ON argument.
     
          It is an error to try to position the CURLINE on the same
          line as a line already allocated by one of <SET HEXSHOW>,

     DESCRIPTION
          The SET DEFSORT command allows the user to determine the order
          in which files appear in a DIR.DIR file.
     
          'Directory' specifies that directories within the current directory
          are shown before other files.
     
          'Size' specifies that the size of the file determines the order
          in which files are displayed.
     
          'Date' specifies that the date of the last change to the file
          determines the order in which files are displayed. If the dates
          are the same, the time the file was last changed is used as a
          secondary sort key.
     
          'Time' specifies that the time of the file determines the order
          in which files are displayed.
     
          'Name' specifies that the name of the file determines the order in
          which files are displayed. This is the default.  Files are sorted
          by name as a secondary sort key when any of the above options are
          specified and two files have equal values for that sort option.
     
          'OFF' indicates that no ordering of the files in the directory
          is performed.  On directories with a large number of files, this
          option results in a displayed DIR.DIR file much quicker than any
          sorted display.
     
          The second parameter specifies if the sort order is ascending or
          descending.
     
          If this command is issued while the DIR.DIR pseudo file is the current
          file, the settings are applied immediately.

          [SET] ETMODE ON|OFF [character list]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SET ETMODE command allows the user to specify which characters
          in a character set are to be displayed as their actual representation.
     
          Those characters not explicitly specified to be displayed as they are
          represented, will be displayed as the <SET NONDISP> character in the
          colour specified by <SET COLOUR> NONDISP. Characters below 32, will
          be displayed with an alphabetic character representing the "control"
          code.
     
          e.g.
          character code with a value of 7, will display as "G" in the colour
          specified by <SET COLOUR> NONDISP.
     
          'ON' with no optional 'character list' will display ALL
          characters as their actual representation.
     
          'OFF' with no optional 'character list' will display control
          characters below ASCII 32, as a "control" character; characters
          greater than ASCII 126 will be displayed as the <SET NONDISP>
          characters. On ASCII based machines, [SET] ETMODE OFF is
          equivalent  to [SET] ETMODE ON 32-126. On EBCDIC based machines
          [SET] ETMODE OFF is equivalent to [SET] ETMODE ON ??-??
     
          The 'character list' is a list of positive numbers between 0 and
          255 (inclusive).  The format of this character list can be either
          a single number; e.g. 124, or a range of numbers specified; e.g.
          32-126. (The first number must be less than or equal to the second
          number).
     
          As an example; ETMODE ON 32-127 160-250  would result in the
          characters with a decimal value between 32 and 127 inclusive
          and 160 and 250 inclusive being displayed as their actual
          representation (depending on the current font), and the
          characters between 0 and 31 inclusive, being displayed as
          an equivalent "control" character; characters between 128 and
          159 inclusive and 250 to 255 being displayed with the <SET NONDISP>
          character.
     
          Up to 20 character specifiers (single number or range) can be
          specified.

          [SET] FILEName filename
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SET FILEName command allows the user to change the filename of
          the file currently being edited.
     
          In THE, a fully qualified file name consists of a file path and a
          file name.  THE treats all characters up to and including the
          last directory separator (usually / or \) as the file's path.
          From the first character after the end of the file's path, to
          the end of the fully qualified file name is the file name.
     
          A file name is further broken down into a fname and fext.
          The fname of a file consists of all characters from the start
          of the filename up to but not including the last period (if
          there is one).  The fext of a file consists of all characters
          from the end of the filename up to but not including the last
          period. If there is no period in the filename then the fext is
          empty.
     
          The fmode of a file is equivalent to the drive letter of the file's
          path. This is only valid under DOS, OS/2 and Windows ports.
     
          Some examples.

          *----------------------------------------------------------------
     
          A limited amount of validation of the resulting file name is
          carried out by this command, but some errors in the file name
          will not be evident until the file is saved.
     
          A leading "=" indicates that the fname portion of the current file
          name is be retained.  This is equivalent to the command
          <SET FEXT>.  A trailing "=" indicates that the fext portion of
          the current file name is to be retained. This is equivalent to the
          command <SET FNAME>.

     SYNTAX
          [SET] HEXShow ON|OFF [M[+n|-n]|[+|-]n]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SET HEXShow command indicates if and where a hexadecimal
          representation of the <current line> will be displayed.
     
          The first form of parameters is:
     
          M[+n|-n]
          this sets the hexshow line to be relative to the middle of
          the screen. A positive value adds to the middle line number,
          a negative subtracts from it.
          e.g. M+3 on a 24 line screen will be line 15
              M-5 on a 24 line screen will be line 7
     
          The second form of parameters is:
     
          [+|-]n
          this sets the hexshow line to be relative to the top of the
          screen (if positive or no sign) or relative to the bottom
          of the screen if negative.
          e.g. +3 or 3 will set current line to line 3
              -3 on a 24 line screen will be line 21
     
          If the resulting line is outside the bounds of the screen
          the position of the hexshow line will become the middle line
          on the screen.
     
          The position argument specifies the position of the first line
          of the hexadecimal display.
     
          It is an error to try to position the HEXSHOW lines on the same
          line as <SET CURLINE>.

     SYNTAX
          [SET] INTerface CLASSIC|CUA
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SET INTERFACE command changes the behaviour of several operations
          within THE.  THE normally operates in a block-mode manner, however
          many applications conform to the Common User Access (CUA) standard
          developed by IBM.  This command specifies that CUA behaviour should
          occur on various actions during the edit session.
     
          The major differences between CLASSIC and CUA behaviour involve
          keyboard and mouse actions. Various THE commands have CUA options to
          allow the user to customise the behaviour individual keys or the
          mouse to behave in a CUA manner.
     
          Where behaviour is not related to particular key or mouse actions,
          this command provides the mechanism for changing the behaviour.
          The behaviour that SET INTERFACE affects:
     
          - entering text in the filearea with a marked CUA block will
            first delete the block and reposition the cursor
          - executing <SOS DELCHAR> or <SOS DELBACK> will delete the
            marked CUA block
          - executing any positioning command, such as <CURSOR> DOWN,
            <FORWARD> or <CURSOR> MOUSE, will unmark the CUA block

          [SET] LASTOP operand text
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SET LASTOP command sets the values of the specified 'operand' to the
          'text' supplied. This command is most useful when run from a macro, to
          set the string to be passed to the next invocation of the equivalent
          'operand' command; eg LOCATE, FIND, etc.
     
          Because THE does not save the contents of the lastop from a command when
          run from a macro, sometimes the macro is intended to set this value. This
          command allows that capability.

     DESCRIPTION
          The SET LINEFLAGS command controls the line characteristics of lines
          in a file.
     
          Each line in a file has certain characteristics associated with it
          depending on how the line has been modified.  On reading a file from
          disk, all lines in the file are set to their default values.
     
          Once a line is modified, or tagged, the characteristics of the line
          are set appropriately.  A line that is added, is set to NEW; a line
          that is changed is set to CHANGE, and a line that is tagged with the
          <TAG> command, is set to TAG.  All three characteristics can be on

          support in THE.  With mouse support, THE commands assigned to
          a mouse button event will be executed.  See APPENDIX 3 for
          details on default mouse support.
     
          If the platform does not support mouse operations, the default
          setting will be OFF.

     COMMAND
          set msgline - set position and size of message line
     
     SYNTAX
          [SET] MSGLine ON M[+n|-n]|[+|-]n [lines] [Overlay]
          [SET] MSGLine CLEAR
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SET MSGLINE set command specifies the position of the
          <message line> and the size of the message line window.
     
          The first form of positional parameters is:
     
          M[+n|-n]
          this sets the first line to be relative to the middle of
          the screen. A positive value adds to the middle line number,
          a negative subtracts from it.
          e.g. M+3 on a 24 line screen will be line 15
              M-5 on a 24 line screen will be line 7
     
          The second form of positional parameters is:
     
          [+|-]n
          this sets the first line to be relative to the top of the
          screen (if positive or no sign) or relative to the bottom
          of the screen if negative.
          e.g. +3 or 3 will set first line to line 3
              -3 on a 24 line screen will set first line to line 21
     
          If the resulting line is outside the bounds of the screen
          the position of the message line will become the middle line
          on the screen.
     
          The 'lines' argument specifies the maximum number of lines of
          error messages to display at the one time.  If this value is
          specified as a whole number it must be less than or equal to the
          number of lines that could fit on the screen from the starting row.
          '*' can be specified to indicate that as many lines as possible should
          be displayed.
     
          All options can be specified as the current EQUIVCHAR to retain the
          existing value.
     
          The second format of the command clears the messages being displayed.
          This is useful in macros where you need to display an error message
          but also want to be able to clear it.

          [SET] PREfix Synonym newname oldname
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The first form of the SET PREFIX command allows the user to display
          the <prefix area> and optionally to select the position were the
          prefix should be displayed.
     
          The second form of the SET PREFIX command is functionally the same
          as the first form. The difference is that when the prefix area
          is displayed with <SET NUMBER> ON, numbers are displayed with leading
          spaces rather than zeros; with <SET NUMBER> OFF, blanks are displayed
          instead of equal signs.
     
          The third form, turns the display of the prefix area off.
          Executed from within the profile, the only effect is that the
          defaults for all files is changed.
          Executed from the command line, the SET PREFIX command changes the
          current window displays to reflect the required options.
     
          The fourth form of the SET PREFIX command allows the user to specify
          a synonym for a prefix command or Rexx prefix macro. The 'newname'
          is the command entered in the prefix area and 'oldname' corresponds
          to an existing prefix command or a Rexx macro file in the MACROPATH
          ending in .the or whatever the value of <SET MACROEXT> is at the time the
          prefix command is executed. The 'oldname' can also be the fully
          qualified filename of a Rexx macro.
          To turn off a prefix synonym, call SET PREFIX newname oldname where
          'newname' and 'oldname' are the same and 'newname' is an existing prefix
          command or macro.
     
          The first and second forms of the SET PREFIX command allows the user
          to specify the width of the prefix area and optionally a gap between
          the prefix area and the filearea.
          'm' can be specified as an unsigned number between 2 and 20 inclusive.
          'n' can be specified as an unsigned number between 0 and 18, but less
          than the number specified in 'm'.

     SYNTAX
          [SET] PRINTER spooler|[OPTION options]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SET PRINTER command sets up the print spooler name to determine
          where output from the <PRINT> command goes.
     
          The 'options' can be one of the following:
          CPI n                           (characters per inch)

          ORIENTation Portrait|Landscape
          FONT fontname                   (name of fixed width font)
     
          No checking is done for printer options. i.e. You may specify a
          font that THE doesn't know about, and the printing process may
          not work after that.
     
          The defaults for page layout for Win32 are:
          CPI 16
          LPI 8
          ORIENTation Portrait
          FONT LinePrinter BM
     
          'options' are only valid for Win32 platform.
          Printer output for the Win32 platform ALWAYS goes to the default
          printer. Therefore, the 'spooler' option is invalid on this

     SYNTAX
          [SET] READONLY ON|OFF|FORCE [File]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SET READONLY command allows the user to disallow changes to
          files if they are readonly.  Normally, if a file is readonly, THE
          allows the user to make changes to the file contents while in the
          editing session, but does not allow the file to be saved.
     
          With READONLY ON, THE disallows any changes to be made to the
          contents of the file in memory, in much the same way that THE
          disallows changes to be made to any files, if THE is started
          with the -r command line switch.
     
          With READONLY FORCE, THE disallows any changes to be made to the
          contents of the file in memory, in the same way that THE
          disallows changes to be made to any files, if THE is started
          with the -r command line switch.
     
          While the -r command line switch disallows changes to be made to
          any files, SET READONLY ON, only disallows changes to be made to
          readonly files. SET READONLY FORCE disallows changes to be made to
          the any files irrespective of whether they are readonly on disk.
     
          With the [File] option, SET READONLY ON and SET READONLY FORCE
          will result in the current file being readonly. SET READONLY OFF
          will allow changes to be made to the current file, provided the
          global READONLY status is OFF.

     SYNTAX
          [SET] RESERved [AUTOSCroll] *|+|-n [colour] [text|OFF]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SET RESERVED command reserves a line for the display of arbitrary
          text by the user. The position is determined by +|-n.
          This number, if positive, specifies the line relative from the
          top of the display. A negative number is relative from the
          bottom of the display.
     
          By specifying a line, say +3, then the third line from the top will
          be reserved, with the supplied text being displayed in that line.
     
          The <idline> of a file will always be displayed after any reserved
          lines.
     
          The <status line> is not considered part of the displayable area,
          so any positioning specifications ignore that line.
     
          A <reserved line> can only be turned off by identifying it in the
          same way that it was defined.  If a <reserved line> was added with
          the position specification of -1, it cannot be turned off with
          a position specification of 23, even though both position
          specifiers result in the same display line.
     
          All reserved lines may be turned of by specifying * as the number
          of lines.
     
          By default, reserved lines are fixed; that is the left portion of
          the reserved line that can be displayed stays displayed irrespective
          of whether the file contents have been scrolled left or right.
          With the 'AUTOSCroll' option, the text of the reserved line is
          scrolled with the file contents using the same settings as
          <SET AUTOSCROLL>.
     
          The colour option specifies the colours to use to display the
          reserved line. The format of this colour specifier is the same
          as for <SET COLOUR>. If no colour is specified, the colour of the
          reserved line will be the colour set by any <SET COLOUR> RESERVED
          command for the view or white on black by default.
     
          The text of reserved lines can also included embedded control
          characters to control the colour of portions of the text.
          Assume the following <SET CTLCHAR> commands have been issued:
     
               SET CTLCHAR ESCAPE !
               SET CTLCHAR @ PROTECT BOLD RED ON WHITE
               SET CTLCHAR % PROTECT GREEN ON BLACK
     
          Then to display a <reserved line> using the specified colours:
     
               SET RESERVED -1 normal!@bold red on white!%green on black
     
          It is an error to try to reserve a line which is the same line as
          <SET CURLINE>.

          [SET] SCALe ON|OFF [M[+n|-n]|[+|-]n]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SET SCALE command sets the position and status of the scale line
          for the current view.
     
          The first form of parameters is:
     
          M[+n|-n]
          this sets the <scale line> to be relative to the middle of
          the screen. A positive value adds to the middle line number,
          a negative subtracts from it.
          e.g. M+3 on a 24 line screen will be line 15
              M-5 on a 24 line screen will be line 7
     
          The second form of parameters is:
     
          [+|-]n
          this sets the <scale line> to be relative to the top of the
          screen (if positive or no sign) or relative to the bottom
          of the screen if negative.
          e.g. +3 or 3 will set current line to line 3
              -3 on a 24 line screen will be line 21
     
          If the resulting line is outside the bounds of the screen
          the position of the current line will become the middle line
          on the screen.

     DESCRIPTION
          The SET SCREEN command specifies the number of views of file(s) to
          display on screen at once. If the number of views specified is 2
          and only one file is currently in the <ring>, two views of the
          same file are displayed.
     
          The second form of SET SCREEN allows the user to specify the
          number of lines that each screen occupies.  The sum of 'l1' and
          'l2' must equal to lscreen.5 or lscreen.5 - 1 if the <status line>
          is displayed.
     
          The value of 'l1' specifies the size of the topmost screen; 'l2'
          specifies the size of the bottommost screen.
     
          Either 'l1' or 'l2' can be set to *, but not both.  The * signifies
          that the screen size for the specified screen will be the remainder
          of the full display window after the size of the other screen
          has been subtracted.
     
          The third form of SET SCREEN allows the user to specify the
          number of columns that each screen occupies.  The sum of 'c1' and
          'c2' must equal to lscreen.6.
     
          The value of 'c1' specifies the size of the leftmost screen; 'c2'
          specifies the size of the rightmost screen.
     
          Either 'c1' or 'c2' can be set to *, but not both.  The * signifies
          that the screen size for the specified screen will be the remainder

          the screen.
     
          The 'n' argument of the command represents the label
          number from left to right, with the first label numbered 1.
     
          'OFF' turns off display of the Soft Label Keys.
     
          'ON' restores the display of the Soft Label Keys.
     
          The main use for this command is to describe the function assigned

          The 'option' argument is any value returned by the <EXTRACT>
          command. eg NBFILE.1.
     
          The syntax of the ON option, displays the specified value, at the
          position in the <status line> specified by 'column'.  If supplied,
          'length' specifies the number of characters, beginning at the
          first character of the returned value, to display.  A value of 0
          indicates that the full value if to be displayed.  The optional
          'prompt' argument, allows the user to specify a string to display
          immediately before the returned value.
     
          OFF, removes the specified 'option' from displaying.  If '*'
          is specified, all displayed options will be removed.
     
          'column' is relative to the start of the <status line>.  The
          value of 'column' must be > 9, so that the version of THE is
          not obscured.
     
          Options will be displayed in the order in which they are set.
     
          If <SET CLOCK> or <SET HEX> are ON, these will take precedence
          over options specified with this command.
     
          The more values you display the longer it will take THE to display
          the <status line>.  Also, some values that are available via
          <EXTRACT> are not really suitable for use here. eg CURLINE.3.

          The SET SYNONYM command allows the user to define synonyms for

          The first format indicates if synonym processing is to be performed.
     
          The second format defines a command synonym.
     
          The synonym is 'newname', which effectively adds a new THE
          command with the definition specified by 'definition'.  The 'n'
          parameter defines the minimum length of the abbreviation for
          the new command
          An optional LINEND character can be specified prior to 'newname'
          if the 'definition' contains multiple commands.
     
          'definition' can be of the form:
          [REXX] command [args] [#command [args] [...]]
          (where # represents the LINEND character specified prior to
          'newname')
     
          If the optional keyword; 'REXX', is supplied, the remainder of the
          command line is treated as a Rexx macro and is passed onto the
          Rexx interpreter (if you have one) for execution.

          a synonym cannot be specified in the 'definition'.

     DESCRIPTION
          The SET TABLINE command sets the position and status of the <tab line>
          for the current view.
     
          The first form of parameters is:
     
          M[+n|-n]
          this sets the <tab line> to be relative to the middle of

          a negative subtracts from it.
          e.g. M+3 on a 24 line screen will be line 15
              M-5 on a 24 line screen will be line 7
     
          The second form of parameters is:
     
          [+|-]n
          this sets the <tab line> to be relative to the top of the
          screen (if positive or no sign) or relative to the bottom
          of the screen if negative.
          e.g. +3 or 3 will set current line to line 3
              -3 on a 24 line screen will be line 21
     
          If the resulting line is outside the bounds of the screen
          the position of the current line will become the middle line
          on the screen.
     
          It is an error to try to position the TABL line on the same
          line as <SET CURLINE>.

     DESCRIPTION
          The SET TABS command determines the position of tab columns in THE.
     
          The first format of SET TABS, specifies individual tab columns. Each
          column must be greater than the column to its left.
     
          The second format specifies the tab increment to use. ie each tab
          column will be set at each 'n' columns.
     
          The third format specifies that no tab columns are to be set.
     
          Tab columns are used by <SOS TABF>, <SOS TABB> and <SOS SETTAB>
          commands to position the cursor and also by the <COMPRESS> and
          <EXPAND> commands.

     SYNTAX
          [SET] TARGETSAVE ALL|NONE| STRING REGEXP ABSOLUTE RELATIVE POINT BLANK
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SET TARGETSAVE command allows you to specify which target
          types are saved for subsequent calls to the LOCATE command without any
          parameters.
     
          By default; SET TARGETSAVE ALL, the LOCATE command without any
          parameters, locates the last target irrespective of the type of target.
     
          SET TARGETSAVE NONE turns off saving of targets, but does not delete
          any already saved target.
     
          Any combination of the target types, STRING, REGEXP, ABSOLUTE, RELATIVE,
          POINT, or BLANK can be supplied. e.g. SET TARGETSAVE STRING POINT.
     
          As an example, having SET TARGETTYPE STRING then the only target saved
          will be one that has a string target component.
          i.e. if you executed LOCATE /fred/ then LOCATE :3 then LOCATE, the final
          LOCATE will look for /fred/ NOT :3

     SYNTAX
          [SET] TRAILING ON|OFF|REMOVE|SINGLE|EMPTY
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The SET TRAILING set command determines how trailing blanks on
          lines are handled when written to disk.
          TRAILING ON means that THE will not treat trailing blanks any
          differently from any other characters in the file. Trailing blanks
          are left on the line while reading in and editing, and retained
          when the file is written to disk.
          With TRAILING OFF, THE will remove trailing blanks when a file is
          read, remove them during an edit session, and not write any trailing
          blanks to the file.
          With TRAILING REMOVE, THE will leave trailing blanks on the end of a
          line when the file is read in and during editing, but will remove
          trailing blanks when a file is written to disk.
          TRAILING SINGLE is the same as TRAILING OFF, except that a single
          blank character is appended to the end of every line when the file
          is written.
          TRAILING EMPTY is the same as TRAILING OFF, except that otherwise
          empty lines will be written with a single trailing blank.
     
          Note that the default for this under THE is ON. This is because of
          the way that THE processes profile files.  If the default was OFF,
          and you had TRAILING ON in your profile, then there would be no
          way to retain the original trailing blanks.
     
          If THE is started with -u switch, then any change to TRAILING is ignored;
          the file will be handled as though TRAILING ON is in effect.

          With TYPEAHEAD ON, curses will abort screen display if a keystroke

          At this stage in the development of THE, setting UNDOING to OFF
          stops THE from saving changes made to lines in a file, and
          prevents those lines from being able to be RECOVERed.

     IMPLIED EXTRACT
     ========================================================================
     
          The above <REXX> variables set by the <EXTRACT> command may also
          be obtained by a REXX macro as an implied EXTRACT. Each variable
          above that may be set by an explicit EXTRACT command may also be
          e.g. The REXX commands:
     
              'EXTRACT /SIZE/CURLINE/'
              Say size.1 curline.1
     
          may be substituted with:
     
              Say size.1() curline.1()
     
     
     ========================================================================
     BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS
     ========================================================================
     
          THE also provides other information to the REXX interpreter via
          boolean functions. These functions return either '1' or '0'
          depending on the information queried.
     
     after()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is currently after the last non-blank
          character on the line, or if the line is blank.
     
     altkey()
          Returns '1' if at the time the last key was pressed, the ALT
          key was also being held down.
     
     alt()
          Returns '1' if the file being edited has changed since the
          last SAVE. i.e. if the value of alt.2 is non zero.
     
     blank()
          Returns '1' if the line the <cursor field> is completely blank.
     
     batch()
          Returns '1' if THE is being run in batch mode. ie THE was
          started with the -b switch.
     
     block()
          Returns '1' if the marked <block> is within the current view.
     
     before()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is currently before the first non-blank
          character on the line, or if the line is blank.
     
     bottomedge()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is on the bottom edge of the <filearea>
          or <prefix area>.
     
     command()
          Returns '1' if the <command line> is on. This is different to
          the definition in KEDIT; "Returns '1' if the cursor is on the
          command line." To get the equivalent KEDIT functionality
          use incommand();
     
     ctrl()
          Returns '1' if at the time the last key was pressed, the CTRL
          key was also being held down.
     
     current()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is on the <current line>.
     
     dir()
          Returns '1' if the current file is the special DIR.DIR file.
     
     end()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is on the last non-blank character on
          the line.
     
     eof()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is on the <Bottom-of-File line>
          and the cursor is not on the <command line>.
     
     first()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is in column 1 of the current window.
     
     focuseof()
          Returns '1' if the focus line is the <Bottom-of-File line>
          whether the cursor is on it or not.
     
     focustof()
          Returns '1' if the <focus line> is the <Top-of-File line>
          whether the cursor is on it or not.
     
     inblock()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is in the marked <block>.
     
     incommand()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is on the <command line>.
     
     initial()
          Returns '1' if the function is called when THE is executing the <profile>
          against files specified on the Operating System command line. Once THE is
          ready to accept the first keystroke, not as a result of a command from within
          <profile>, this function returns 0;
     
     inprefix()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is located in the <prefix area>.
     
     insertmode()
          Returns '1' if THE is in INSERT mode.
     
     leftedge()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is on the left edge of the <filearea>.
     
     modifiable()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is located in an area that can be changed.
          i.e. not on <Top-of-File line> or <Bottom-of-File line> nor on a
          <shadow line>.
     
     rightedge()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is on the right edge of the <filearea>.
     
     shadow()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is on a <shadow line>.
     
     shift()
          Returns '1' if at the time the last key was pressed, the SHIFT
          key was also being held down.
     
     spacechar()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is on a space character.
     
     tof()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is on the <Top-of-File line>
          and the cursor is not on the <command line>.
     
     topedge()
          Returns '1' if the cursor is on the top edge of the <filearea>.
     
     verone()
          Returns '1' if the column 1 of the file is being displayed in
          column 1.
     
     ========================================================================
     OTHER FUNCTIONS
     ========================================================================
     
          The following functions provide features to simplify THE macros
          written in REXX.
     
     valid_target(target[,anything])
          The first argument is the <target> to be validated. If a second,
          optional argument is supplied, the target to be validated can
          consist of a target followed by any optional characters. This can
          be useful if the arguments to a macro consist of a target followed
          by another argument. If a valid target is supplied, the remainder
          of the string passed to valid_target() is returned following the
          first line affected and the number of lines to the target.
     
          Returns 'ERROR' if the supplied target is invalid.
          Returns 'NOTFOUND' if the supplied target is valid, but not found.
     
          If a valid target, returns the first line affected by the target
          followed by the number of lines to the target, and optionally the
          remainder of the argument. e.g.
     
          if the focus line is 12 and valid_target() is called as
     
              result = valid_target(":7")      ===> result = "12 -5"
     
          if the focus line is 12 and valid_target is called as
     
              result = valid_target(":7 /fred/",junk), ===> result = "12 -5 /fred/"
     
     run_os(command[,stdin_stem[,stdout_stem[,stderr_stem]]])
          This function allows the macro writer to call an operating system
          command and have the standard streams; 'stdin', 'stdout' and 'stderr'
          redirected to or from REXX arrays.
     
          The first argument is the operating system command to execute.
          The command can include any command line switches appropriate
          to the command.
     
          All other arguments comprise a stem name (including a trailing '.')
          which refers to the REXX arrays where 'stdin', 'stdout' and 'stderr'
          are to be redirected.
     
          As with all REXX arrays, the value of the 0th element (stem.0)
          contains the number of elements in the array.
     
          The only restriction with the names of the stem variables is
          that the stem name for the 'stdin' stem cannot be the same as the
          stem for 'stdout' or 'stderr'.
     
          The stem name for 'stdout' and 'stderr' can be the same; the contents
          of the resulting output stems will consist of 'stdout' and 'stderr' in
          the order that the command generates this output.
     
          Return values:
     
               0    - successful
               1005 - invalid argument or syntax
               1012 - problems with system redirection of streams
               1094 - out of memory
               1099 - error interfacing to REXX interpreter
     
          all other numbers, return code from operating system command
     
          e.g. to spell check the words "The Hessling Editr" with ispell
     
              in.0 = 3
              in.1 = "The"
              in.2 = "Hessling"
              in.3 = "Editr"
              rc = run_os("ispell -a","in.","out.")
     
          sets:
     
               out.0 --> 3
               out.1 --> "*"
               out.2 --> "#"
               out.3 --> "& edits edit editor"

     APPENDIX 1 - ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     ========================================================================
     
     THE defines the following environment variables:
     
      THE_HOME_DIR - the directory in which THE looks for its help file(s) and macro(s)
     
      THE_HELP_FILE - the fully qualified file name containing help information.
     
      THE_PROFILE_FILE - the fully qualified file name for the default <profile> file.
     
      THE_MACRO_PATH - a list of all directories in which THE is to look for <macro> files.
     
     THE is also influenced by the following Rexx/Trans environment variables:
     
      REXXTRANS_INTERPRETER and REXXTRANS_TRACEFILE - See the Rexx/Trans documentation
      at http://rexxtrans.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html
     
     
     -----------------------------------
     Environment Variable Use under UNIX
     -----------------------------------
     
     If no environment variable; THE_HOME_DIR, is set prior to starting THE,
     THE uses /usr/local/THE/ as the default value for ${THE_HOME_DIR} if running
     under Unix.  This can be changed when running the configure script. See
     the file INSTALL for further details.
     
     The default value of THE_HELP_FILE is THE_Help.txt. With no environment
     variables set, the help file to be looked for will be /usr/local/THE/THE_Help.txt.
     If THE_HOME_DIR environment variable was set to /usr/opt/etc or changed in
     the.c, the help file will be /usr/opt/etc/THE_Help.txt.
     
     The name of the default profile file is $HOME/.therc. If this file
     does not exist and THE is built from source with the
     --with-global-profile switch then THE will execute the "global" profile file
     specified with that switch.
     
     The default value of THE_MACRO_PATH is ${THE_HOME_DIR}:. THE will look for
     a macro file first in ${THE_HOME_DIR} and then in the current directory.
     So with no environment variables set, THE looks for macros in
     $(THE_HOME_DIR} first and if no file exists in that directory, THE will
     look in the current directory. If the file does not exist in either of
     these places, an error message will be displayed.
     The format of THE_MACRO_PATH is dir1:dir2:dir3 Each directory is separated
     by colons. By default, up to 20 directories may be specified. This can be
     changed in the.h when building or by the <SET MACROPATH> command.
     
     
     -----------------------------------------------------
     Environment Variable Use under OS/2, DOS and Win95/NT
     -----------------------------------------------------
     
                               *********
     
     Under some circumstances the following default behaviour does not occur.
     The reason is that THE.EXE sometimes cannot determine where it was run
     from.  This is a due to the different ways that different operating
     systems behave and how the C compiler used to build THE behaves.
     
     It is probably better to explicitly set the environment variables than
     hope that your particular environment will work as documented below.
     
                               *********
     
     By default THE_HOME_DIR is set to the directory from which THE was
     invoked. Assuming THE.EXE resides in d:\tools, THE_HOME_DIR will equate
     to d:\tools\.
     
     The default value of THE_HELP_FILE is THE_Help.txt.
     
     The name of the default profile file is ${THE_HOME_DIR}profile.the.
     
     The default value of THE_MACRO_PATH is ${THE_HOME_DIR};. THE will look for
     a macro file first in THE_HOME_DIR and then in the current directory. So
     with no environment variables set, THE first looks for macros in the
     directory from which THE was invoked and then in the current directory.
     If the file does not exist in either directory, an error message is displayed.
     The format of THE_MACRO_PATH is dir1;dir2;dir3 Each directory is separated
     by semi-colons. By default, up to 20 directories may be specified. This can
     be changed by the <SET MACROPATH> command.

     APPENDIX 2 - KEYBOARD HANDLING IN THE
     ========================================================================
     
     This appendix contains information on how THE handles keystrokes in the
     U*ix environment.  One thing that is consistant with PCs is keyboard
     handling.  Therefore this explanation is not applicable to the PC
     arena.
     
     Keystroke handling is a very complicated business! There are so many
     layers between the physical keyboard and the application; in this case
     THE. These layers can be best described with the following diagrams:

     Each layer is described below
     
     -----------------
     Physical keyboard
     -----------------
     
     Each keyboard is potentially different from every other.  The similarity
     that they do possess is that when a key is pressed, a unique code is
     generated. The state of the Shift, Control, Num Lock, Alt modifiers
     either alter the unique code generated or a separate code is generated
     to identify to the next layer that the key pressed should be modified.
     
     -----------------
     terminal emulator
     -----------------
     
     This is a required layer if the user is connected to the host via some
     emulation software. eg a PC connected to a U*ix host requires a terminal
     emulator of one sort or another.
     
     The terminal emulator translates the unique codes generated by the
     keyboard usually into physical escape sequences that are passed to
     the U*ix shell.  These escape sequences can be seen by running the
     U*ix command 'cat -v'.  When you press a key on the keyboard while
     in 'cat -v', the escape sequences that the terminal emulator has
     generated are displayed. Some systems require the Enter key to be
     pressed before the escape sequence is displayed.  The term "escape
     sequence" is used because in most cases, the first character
     generated is an Escape character (hex 1B).  Following the escape
     is any number of other characters, which together form a unique
     sequence of characters.
     
     When using a terminal directly, firmware on the terminal does the
     generation of the escape sequences. Some terminals allow the user
     to specify what escape sequence will be generated when particular
     keys are pressed.
     
     ----------------
     Termcap/Terminfo
     ----------------
     
     Each terminal that connects to a U*ix host is identified by the value
     of the TERM environment variable.  The value of TERM is used to setup
     various settings for the terminal.  These settings are stored in a
     database; either in a flat file 'termcap' or in a compiled format
     'terminfo'. Which one a particular system uses is dependant on the
     version of the U*ix Operating System being run.
     
     One of the capabilities of the termcap/terminfo databases is to
     translate an escape sequence into a keyboard mnemonic that is used
     by the Curses library functions.  This translation can also be
     changed by the user.
     
     An example of this is:
     
         +------------------------------
         Termcap:  ku=\E[A
         Terminfo: kcuu1=\E[A
         +------------------------------
     
     This translates the escape sequence ESC [ A into the mnemonic ku or
     kccu1.
     
     ------
     Curses
     ------
     
     The Curses library contains definitions of many keys.  These can be
     seen by looking in the Curses header file; usually /usr/include/curses.h
     Here you will see definitions like:
     
         +------------------------------
         #define KEY_UP 0403 /* up arrow key */
         +------------------------------
     
     ---
     THE
     ---
     
     As THE is a Curses-based application, it recognises the Curses key
     definitions defined in curses.h.  As not all escape sequences are
     usually defined in the Termcap/Terminfo databases, or are defined in
     curses.h, THE also has special code to decipher other escape sequences.
     
     When a key is pressed, and is interpreted by THE, the first action is
     to check if the value passed to THE is a 'known' curses key. If it is
     THE carries out any command associated with the key.  If the value
     is not a 'known' curses key, THE assumes that an escape sequence is
     forthcoming.  The module getch.c has code for deciphering many escape
     sequences that are not normally defined in the Termcap/Terminfo
     database.  Later in this document is a table of escape sequences and
     its associated curses key.
     
     ----------
     X11 Server
     ----------
     
     When THE is run in a X environment, the X server acts in a similar way
     to terminal emulation software.  The principal difference is that there
     are more layers within the X server.  The translation of physical
     keyboard codes to an X mnemonic is the first layer.  The code generated
     is called a keycode.  This keycode is then translated into another
     higher level mnemonic; a keysym.  The keysym is usually a name that
     resembles the label on the physical keyboard.
     
     The X environment provides a mechanism to assign keycodes to keysyms.
     This is done with the xmodmap command, and any assignment of keycode
     to keysym is done for all applications within the current X environment.
     
     -----
     xterm
     -----
     
     The xterm program is a terminal emulation program, and as such has many
     of the properties of the terminal emulator described above.
     The xterm program takes keysyms from the X11 server and generates
     escape sequences, which are defined in the xterm entry in the Termcap/
     Terminfo database.
     
     One of the features of xterm is the ability to alter the standard keysym to
     escape sequence translation.  Surprisingly this is via a feature called
     'translations'.  Not only do these translations enable the user to
     specify a different escape sequences to be generated, but internal
     xterm commands can also be assigned.  These are beyond the scope of
     this description. An example of an xterm translation follows:
     
         +------------------------------
         *VT100.Translations: #override\n\
          <Key>F1: string(0x1b) string("[192z")\n\
          <Key>F2: string(0x1b) string("[193z")\n
         +------------------------------
     
     This specification is typically part of your own $HOME/.Xdefaults file.
     This file is usually read dynamically by the xterm program on startup.
     On some systems, the .Xdefaults file is ignored.  To ensure the entries
     are incorporated into the X server resource database, run the command:
     
         +------------------------------
         xrdb -merge .Xdefaults
         +------------------------------
     
     The above example will generate the escape sequence ESC [ 1 9 2 z when
     the F1 key is pressed.  The trailing "\" is a continuation character.
     
     So, if you had the above translation in effect, and were running THE in
     an xterm, and ran the SHOWKEY command, pressing the F1 key would result
     in THE responding with F11.
     
     --------
     PDCurses
     --------
     
     The actions performed by PDCurses in the X environment combine the
     xterm, Termcap/Terminfo and curses actions. This results in fewer
     layers to be traversed.
     
     PDCurses takes a keysym from the X server and converts it into a
     Curses key code.  PDCurses also has the same translation capabilities
     as does xterm.  The xterm example above would look like:
     
         +------------------------------
         *the.Translations: #override\n\
          <Key>F1: string(0x1b) string("[192z")\n\
          <Key>F2: string(0x1b) string("[193z")\n
         +------------------------------
     
     All the details described in xterm as far as translations are concerned
     hold for translations in PDCurses.
     
     Another capability that translations offer is the ability to assign
     international characters to alphabetic characters, while still having
     the alphabetic characters available.  For example, the translations
     below assigns the action of the Shifted Meta key and A, giving a
     capital A with a grave accent, and the unshifted Meta key and A giving
     a small A with a grave accent.
     
         +------------------------------
         *the.Translations: #override\n\
          !Shift Meta <Key>a: string(0xc0) \n\
          !Meta       <Key>a: string(0xe0) \n
         +------------------------------
     
     The examples above assume you are using a font with a character set that
     is compatible with ISO 8859-1.

     -----
     NOTES:
     -----
     
     1.  In the X11 port, pressing the middle mouse button anywhere within the
         THE window, will result in the contents of the X selection being pasted
         where the text cursor is currently displayed.  If you hold down
         any modifier key, such as SHIFT or CONTROL, that sequence is
         passed to THE and can be mapped. Therefore; PMB or RMD is NOT
         able to be used in THE, but C-PMB, C-RMB, S-PMB etc. can.
     
     2.  The button action DOUBLE_CLICKED will always be preceded by a CLICK
         action. This is the case for THE with ncurses or PDCurses. Therefore
         itis usually a good idea to have the CLICK action assigned to a
         cursor positioning command if the DOUBLE_CLICK for the same button is
         used.

     ========================================================================
     APPENDIX 4 - SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING IN THE
     ========================================================================
     
     This appendix contains details on syntax highlighting in THE.  Syntax
     highlighting is the mechanism by which different tokens within a file;
     usually containing source code, are displayed in different colours.
     
     The model THE uses for its syntax highlighting is based on the model
     used by KEDIT for Windows from Mansfield Software.  This model is extremely
     configurable and flexible. While most of the KEDIT features are implemented,
     THE also adds a couple of other features that make the syntax highlighting
     even better.
     
     This appendix concentrates on the format of THE language definition
     files. For a description of the commands that manipulate other aspects
     of syntax highlighting in THE, see the descriptions of the following
     commands:
     <SET AUTOCOLOR>, <SET COLORING>, <SET ECOLOR>, <SET PARSER>.
     
     ------------------
     Performance Impact
     ------------------
     
     Syntax highlighting in an editor comes at a cost; reduced performance.
     
     Because of the extra processing required to determine which characters are
     displayed in which colours, displaying the screen is slower.  As THE
     recalculates the display colours after every displayable key is pressed,
     then you may notice a reduction in responsiveness.
     
     The more features that are specified in a TLD, the slower the syntax
     highlighting will be. To dynamically turn on or off the application of
     some headers within a TLD file, see the <SET HEADER> command.
     
     For those languages that allow paired comments (ie they can span multiple
     lines) performance is impacted even more.  This is because THE has to
     determine if the lines being displayed are within one of these multi-line
     comment pairs which may start before the first displayed line.
     
     THE will incorrectly display syntax highlighting in certain circumstances.
     This is because THE does not fully parse the complete file to determine
     the correct colours; that would be too slow.  Instead, THE checks the
     currently displayed lines and determines the syntax highlighting based
     on these lines.
     
     Where THE will get syntax highlighting wrong:
     
     If all displayed lines are within a multi-line comment block and neither
     the starting comment token nor the ending comment token are displayed. THE
     will treat the displayed lines as code.
     
     When the starting or ending comment tokens for multi-line comments are
     part of a language string.
     
     Also bear in mind that excluding large portions of the file with ALL, will
     dramatically slow down checking of multi-line comments.
     
     --------------------------------
     File Extensions Vs Magic Numbers
     --------------------------------
     A THE extension to the KEDIT syntax highlighting model is support for
     <magic numbers>. (See <SET AUTOCOLOR> for more details).  For the default
     <parser>s, where there might be a conflict between setting syntax highlighting
     based on a file extension or a <magic number>, the file extension mapping takes
     precedence.
     
     -----------------------------
     THE Language Definition Files
     -----------------------------
     
     THE Language Definition Files usually have a file extension of .tld.
     THE comes with a small number of sample TLD files. Look at these files in
     conjunction with the following descriptions to fully understand how to
     write your own TLD files.
     
     TLD files consist of several sections identified by header lines. Header
     lines start with a colon in column one.  Items within the particular header
     are listed on separate lines after the header to which they apply.
     Blank lines are ignored, and so are comments (* as first non-blank). Each
     item that can be repeated occurs on a separate line. The above definition
     of what a TLD file looks like is expressed in the TLD file; tld.tld.
     
     Many items in a TLD are specified as a regular expression (RE).  THE supports a
     number of RE syntaxes for targets. All REs specified in a TLD are parsed using
     the EMACS syntax.  For details of RE usage in THE see Appendix 7.
     
     The purpose of each header and the valid contents are explained below.
     
     ...........
     :identifier
     ...........
     This section specifies, using a regular expression how a keyword in the
     language is defined.  The only item line contains three regular expressions
     separated by space characters.
     Syntax:
        first_char_re other_char_re [last_char_re]
     Meaning of options:
        first_char_re
           This regular expression specifies the valid characters that an
           identifier can begin with.
        other_char_re
           This regular expression specifies the valid characters that the
           remainder of characters in an identifier can consist of.
        last_char_re
           This regular expression is optional. If specified, it states the
           valid characters that an identifier can end with.
     
     .....
     :case
     .....
     This section defines whether the case of letters that make up identifiers in
     the language are case-sensitive or not. Only one of the items below can be
     included.
     Syntax:
        RESPECT | IGNORE
     Meaning of options:
        respect
           case is relevant. The keywords 'if', 'IF' and 'If' are different.
        ignore
           case is irrelevant. The keywords 'if' and 'IF' are treated as the
           same identifier.
     
     .......
     :option
     .......
     This section specifies different options that can affect other sections.
     The options below can all be included in the one TLD.
     Syntax:
        REXX
        PREPROCESSOR char
        FUNCTION char BLANK | NOBLANK [DEFAULT ALTernate x]
     Meaning of options:
        rexx
           specifies special processing for Rexx. e.g. Functions defined in
           the :functions section, are also highlighted if preceded by CALL.
        preprocessor char
           languages like C that have preprocessor identifiers usually begin
           with a special character (specified by 'char') to differentiate
           these types of keywords from others.
        function char blank | noblank [default alternate x]
           this option is used to identify how keywords specified in the
           :function section are identified. 'char' specifies the character that
           is used to start a function, usually '('. The 'blank' or 'noblank'
           argument determines if blank characters can appear between the function
           identifier and the function start character. eg a Rexx function
           call must be written without blanks between the function name and
           the function start character: 'word('. In C 'word  (' or 'word('
           are both valid syntax for a function call.
           The optional "default alternate x" specifies the color in which
           functions that are NOT specified in the :function section are to
           be displayed. See the explanation of alternate colors in the :function
           section.
           Without "default alternate x", the color of unknown functions is
           not changed.
     
     .......
     :number
     .......
     This section specifies the format of numbers in the language. Most languages
     use a small number of generic types of numbers.
     Syntax:
        REXX | C | COBOL
     Meaning of options:
     ECOLOR Value:
           Numbers are displayed in the colour specified with ECOLOUR 'C'.
     
     .......
     :string
     .......
     This section specifies how strings within the language are defined.
     Multiple values may be specified, as many languages use both single and
     double quotes.
     Syntax:
        SINGLE [BACKSLASH] | DOUBLE [BACKSLASH]
     Meaning of options:
        single
           Specifies that the language uses single quotes to identify a string.
        double
           Specifies that the language uses double quotes to identify a string.
        backslash
           Some languages require a backslash character immediately preceding
           either a single or double quote to allow the quote to be included
           in the string.
     ECOLOR Character:
           For complete strings, the ECOLOUR character used is 'B'. For incomplete
           strings, the ECOLOUR character used is 'S'.
     
     ........
     :comment
     ........
     This section specifies the format of comments. Both paired and line
     comments can be specified, as can multiple occurrences of each.
     Syntax:
        PAIRED open_string close_string [NEST | NONEST]
        LINE comment_string ANY | FIRSTNONBLANK | COLUMN n
     Meaning of options:
        paired
           These types of comments can span multiple lines. They have an opening
           string and a closing string.
        open_string
           This defines the string that opens a paired comment.
        close_string
           This defines the string that closes a paired comment.
        nest
           Some languages allow paired comments to be nested. (not implemented)
        nonest
           Defining this indicates that the language does not allow nesting
           of paired comments. The effect of this option will result in the
           first close_string to end the paired comment no matter how many
           open_string occurrences there are. (not implemented)
        line
           These type of comments cannot span multiple lines.  Everything on the
           line after the comment_string is considered part of the comment.
        comment_string
           The string that defines a line comment.
        any
           For line comments, this indicates that the comment_string can occur
           anywhere on the line, and all characters following it are part of
           the comment.
        firstnonblank
           For line comments, this indicates that the comment_string can only
           occur as the first non-blank of the line.
        column n
           For line comments, this indicates that the comment_string must
           start in the specified column.
     ECOLOR Character:
           Comments are displayed in the colour specified with ECOLOUR 'A'.
     
     ........
     :keyword
     ........
     This section specifies all of the identifiers that are to be considered
     language keywords. You must specific the :identifier section in the TLD
     file before the :keyword section.
     Syntax:
        keyword [ALTernate x] [TYPE x]
     Meaning of options:
        keyword
           This specifies the string that is considered to be a language
           keyword.
        alternate x
           All keywords are displayed in the same colour, unless you use
           this option to specify a different colour.  In KEDIT there are
           9 alternate colours that can be used; ECOLOUR 1 through 9. In THE
           any ECOLOUR character can be used as an alternate colour.
           'alternate' can be abbreviated to 'alt'.
        type x
           (not implemented)
     ECOLOR Character:
           Unless overridden by the 'alternate' option, the keyword is displayed
           in the colour specified with ECOLOUR 'D'.
     
     .........
     :function
     .........
     This section specifies all of the identifiers that are to be considered
     functions.  Normally this is used for those functions that are builtin
     into the language, but can be any identifier. You specify the function
     identifier without the function char specified in the :option section.
     You must specify the :option and the :identifier sections in the TLD
     file before the :function section.
     Syntax:
        function [ALTernate x]
     Meaning of options:
        function
           This specifies the string that is considered to be a language
           function.
        alternate x
           All functions are displayed in the same colour, unless you use
           this option to specify a different colour.  In KEDIT there are
           9 alternate colours that can be used; ECOLOUR 1 through 9. In THE
           any ECOLOUR character can be used as an alternate colour.
           'alternate' can be abbreviated to 'alt'.
     ECOLOR Character:
           Unless overridden by the 'alternate' option, the function is displayed
           in the colour specified with ECOLOUR 'V'.
     
     .......
     :header
     .......
     This section specifies the format of headers. Headers are lines within a file
     that begin with a particular string and usually identify different parts of
     the file. They are similar to labels.
     Syntax:
        LINE header_string ANY | FIRSTNONBLANK | COLUMN n [ALTernate x]
     Meaning of options:
        header_string
           The string that defines a header.
        any
           This indicates that the header_string can occur anywhere on the line,
           and all characters following it are part of the header.
        firstnonblank
           This indicates that the header_string can only occur as the first
           non-blank of the line.
        column n
           This indicates that the header_string must start in the specified column.
        alternate x
           All headers are displayed in the same colour, unless you use
           this option to specify a different colour.  In KEDIT there are
           9 alternate colours that can be used; ECOLOUR 1 through 9. In THE
           any ECOLOUR character can be used as an alternate colour.
           'alternate' can be abbreviated to 'alt'.
     ECOLOR Character:
           Unless overridden by the 'alternate' option, the function is displayed
           in the colour specified with ECOLOUR 'G'.
     
     ......
     :label
     ......
     This section specifies the format of labels. Labels are lines within a file
     that end with a particular string. They are similar to headers.
     Syntax:
        DELIMITER label_string ANY | FIRSTNONBLANK | COLUMN n
        COLUMN n
     Meaning of options:
        label_string
           The string that defines a label.
        any
           This indicates that the label_string can occur anywhere on the line,
           and all characters up to it are part of the label.
        firstnonblank
           This indicates that the label_string can only occur as the first
           non-blank of the line.
        column n
           As part of a DELIMITER label, this indicates that the label_string
           must start in the specified column. If specified by itself, then the
           label does not require any special delimiter; the non-keyword that
           starts in the specified column is regarded as a label.
     ECOLOR Character:
           Labels are displayed in the colour specified with ECOLOUR 'E'.
     
     .......
     :markup
     .......
     This section specifies the delimiters for a markup tag, and optionally
     the delimiters for references within a markup language.

     .......
     :column
     .......
     This section specifies the range of columns in your file which is to have
     syntax highlighting applied.  For example, columns 1-6 and beyond column
     72 in a COBOL source file should be excluded from being parsed.
     Any number of EXCLUDE clauses are allowed.
     Note. Not all syntax checking respects excluded columns at this stage.
     Syntax:
        EXCLUDE first_column last_column [ALTernate x]
     Meaning of options:
        first_column
           The first column to be excluded

           The last column to be excluded. '*' can be used to specify to the end of
           the line.
        alternate x
           All excluded characters are displayed in the same colour, unless you use
           this option to specify a different colour.  In KEDIT there are
           9 alternate colours that can be used; ECOLOUR 1 through 9. In THE
           any ECOLOUR character can be used as an alternate colour.
           'alternate' can be abbreviated to 'alt'.
     ECOLOR Character:
           Unless overridden by the 'alternate' option, the excluded characters
           are displayed in the colour specified with COLOUR FILEAREA.
     
     ..........
     :directory
     ..........
     This section is applicable only to the pseudo file; DIR.DIR. It is used
     to specify the colour used to display lines in the DIR.DIR file.
     Syntax:
        DIRectory [ALTernate x]
        LINK [ALTernate x]
        EXEcutable [ALTernate x]
        EXTensions ext1 ext2 ext3 ... ALTernate x
     Meaning of options:
        directory
           Indicates that directories are to be highlighted. Unless overridden
           by the 'alternate' option, the matched line is displayed with ECOLOUR 'W'.
        link
           Indicates that symbolic links are to be highlighted. Unless overridden
           by the 'alternate' option, the matched line is displayed with ECOLOUR 'X'.
        executable
           Used to specify the colour used to display executable files. The checking is simple
           and simply determines if the executable bit is set for user, group or world.
           Only applicable to UNIX systems.
           Unless overridden by the 'alternate' option, the matched line is displayed
           with ECOLOUR 'Y'.
        extensions
           A space-separated list of extensions to be displayed in the specifed
           alternate colour.  The complete line is coloured.  The match is applied
           by checking each extension against the characters at the end of the
           line, so while it is intended for extensions, any string that is specified
           as an extension can be matched; it doesn't have to have a period in the
           matched string. A maximum of 10 extensions can be specified on each line.
           The 'alternate' keyword and option must be specified.
        alternate x
           In KEDIT there are 9 alternate colours that can be used; ECOLOUR 1 through 9.
           In THE any ECOLOUR character can be used as an alternate colour.
           'alternate' can be abbreviated to 'alt'.
     
     ............
     :postcompare
     ............
     This section specifies items that are checked for after all other syntax
     checking has been completed.  This can be useful if you want to allow
     user-defined datatypes or other code to be displayed in different colours.
     Syntax:
        CLASS re [ALTernate x]
        TEXT string [ALTernate x]
     Meaning of options:
        re
           This regular expression specifies the text to be highlighted.
        string
           This indicates the literal string to be highlighted.
        alternate x
           All matched postcompare characters are displayed in the same colour,
           unless you use this option to specify a different colour.  In KEDIT
           there are 9 alternate colours that can be used; ECOLOUR 1 through 9.
           In THE any ECOLOUR character can be used as an alternate colour.
           'alternate' can be abbreviated to 'alt'.
     ECOLOR Character:
           Unless overridden by the 'alternate' option, the matched characters
           are displayed in the colour specified with ECOLOUR 'D'.
     
     ---------------
     Builtin Parsers
     ---------------
     THE includes a number of builtin syntax highlighting <parser>s.
     The following table lists the default <parser>s and the files they apply to:
     
      +--------+-----------+----------------+
      | Parser | Filemasks | "Magic Number" |
      +--------+-----------+----------------+
      | REXX   | *.rex     | rexx           |
      |        | *.rexx    | regina         |
      |        | *.cmd     | rxx            |
      |        | *.the     |                |
      |        | .therc    |                |

     ========================================================================
     APPENDIX 7 - REGULAR EXPRESSIONS IN THE
     ========================================================================
     
     This appendix contains details on regular expression usage in THE.  There are
     two places where THE uses regular expressions; in targets in commands like 
     <LOCATE> and <ALL>, and in the specification of patterns in THE Language
     Definition files used for syntax highlighting.
     
     THE uses the GNU Regular Expression Library to implement regular expressions. 
     This library has several different regular expression syntaxes that can be used
     when specifying targets.  
     
     Note that all pattern specifications used for syntax highlighting always uses 
     the EMACS regular expression syntax.
     
     The following table lists the features of each of the regular expression
     syntaxes that can be set via the <SET REGEXP> command.  Each feature in the
     table is explained later.
     
     This appendix is not intended to explain everything about regular expressions.
     If you want to find out more about GNU Regular Expressions, then view the on-line
     documentation at <http://hessling-editor.sf.net/doc/regex/>.

     ------------
     BACKSLASH_ESCAPE_IN_LISTS
     ------------
     If this feature is not set, then \ inside a bracket expression is
     literal.
     If set, then such a \ quotes the following character.
     
     ------------
     BACKSLASH_PLUS_QM
     ------------
     If this feature is not set, then + and ? are operators, and \+ and \? are
     literals. 
     If set, then \+ and \? are operators and + and ? are literals.
     
     ------------
     CHAR_CLASSES
     ------------
     If this feature is set, then character classes are supported.  
     They are:
       [:alpha:], [:upper:], [:lower:],  [:digit:], [:alnum:], [:xdigit:],
       [:space:], [:print:], [:punct:], [:graph:], and [:cntrl:].
     If not set, then character classes are not supported.
     
     ------------
     CONTEXT_INDEP_ANCHORS
     ------------
     If this feature is set, then ^ and $ are always anchors (outside bracket
     expressions, of course). 
     If this feature is not set, then it depends:
          ^  is an anchor if it is at the beginning of a regular
             expression or after an open-group or an alternation operator;
          $  is an anchor if it is at the end of a regular expression, or
             before a close-group or an alternation operator.  
     
     This feature could be (re)combined with CONTEXT_INDEP_OPS, because
     POSIX draft 11.2 says that * etc. in leading positions is undefined.
     
     ------------
     CONTEXT_INDEP_OPS
     ------------
     If this feature is set, then special characters are always special regardless 
     of where they are in the pattern.
     If this feature is not set, then special characters are special only in some 
     contexts; otherwise they are ordinary.  Specifically, * + ? and intervals 
     are only special when not after the beginning, open-group, or alternation operator.
     
     ------------
     CONTEXT_INVALID_OPS
     ------------
     If this feature is set, then *, +, ?, and { cannot be first in an RE or immediately
     after an alternation or begin-group operator.
     
     ------------
     DOT_NEWLINE
     ------------
     If this feature is set, then . matches newline. If not set, then it does not.
     
     ------------
     DOT_NOT_NULL
     ------------
     If this feature is set, then . does not match NUL. If not set, then it does.
     
     ------------
     HAT_LISTS_NOT_NEWLINE
     ------------
     If this feature is set, nonmatching lists [^...] do not match newline. 
     If not set, they do.
     
     ------------
     INTERVALS
     ------------
     If this feature is set, either \{...\} or {...} defines an interval, depending 
     on NO_BACKSLASH_BRACES. 
     If not set, \{, \}, {, and } are literals.
     
     ------------
     LIMITED_OPS
     ------------
     If this feature is set, +, ? and | are not recognized as operators.
     If not set, they are.
     
     ------------
     NEWLINE_ALT
     ------------
     If this feature is set, newline is an alternation operator.
     If not set, newline is literal.
     
     ------------
     NO_BACKSLASH_BRACES
     ------------
     If this feature is set, then `{...}' defines an interval, and \{ and \} are literals.
     If not set, then `\{...\}' defines an interval. 
     
     ------------
     NO_BACKSLASH_PARENS
     ------------
     If this feature is set, (...) defines a group, and \( and \) are literals.
     If not set, \(...\) defines a group, and ( and ) are literals.
     
     ------------
     NO_BACKSLASH_REFS
     ------------
     If this feature is set, then \<digit> matches <digit>. If not set, then \<digit> 
     is a back-reference.
     
     ------------
     NO_BACKSLASH_VBAR
     ------------
     If this feature is set, then | is an alternation operator, and \| is literal. 
     If not set, then \| is an alternation operator, and | is literal.
     
     ------------
     NO_EMPTY_RANGES
     ------------
     If this feature is set, then an ending range point collating higher than the starting 
     range point, as in [z-a], is invalid.
     If not set, then when ending range point collates higher than the starting range 
     point, the range is ignored.
     
     ------------
     UNMATCHED_RIGHT_PAREN_ORD
     ------------
     If this feature is set, then an unmatched ) is ordinary.
     If not set, then an unmatched ) is invalid.

          box block
               A type of <block>.  It is a rectangular portion of the
               <filearea>.
     
          column block
               A type of <block>.  It is similar to a <box block> except that
               a columnar portion of every line in the file is included.
     
          column target
               A method of referring to some part of a line being edited.
     
          command line
               The area of the display, usually identified by an arrow
               prompt, "====>", where THE commands are entered.
     
          current column
               The column in the <filearea>, marked by the "|" character on
               the <scale line>.
     
          current line
               The line in the <filearea>, normally highlighted, from which
               commands entered on the <command line> take effect.
     
          cursor field
               The "field" in which the cursor is currently located. This
               can be the <prefix area>, <command line> or <filearea>.
     
          filearea
               That part of the screen display where the contents of the
               file being edited are displayed.
     
          filetabs
               An optional display component that shows the names of files
               currently in the <ring>. Can be used by versions of THE that
               support mouse actions to bring the clicked file to the
               front of the <ring>
     
          focus column
               The column in the <filearea> which currently has the focus. If
               the cursor is in the <filearea>, it is the column on which the
               cursor is displayed. If the cursor is in the <command line> or
               <prefix area>, the focus column is the <current column>.
     
          focus line
               The line in the <filearea> which currently has the focus. If
               the cursor is in the <filearea> or <prefix area>, it is the line
               on which the cursor is displayed. If the cursor is on the
               <command line>, the focus line is the <current line>. All THE
               commands operate relative to the focus line.
     
          idline
               That part of the screen display which shows details about
               the file being edited.
     
          line block

               the <filearea>.
     
          macro
               A file containing a sequence of THE commands. Macros can
               be written in <REXX> if a supported REXX interpreter is
               available.
     
               *** NOTE ***
     
               If REXX support is NOT enabled in THE, the first line of the THE
               macro file MUST contain the comment:
     
               /*NOREXX*/
     
          magic number
               A magic number is used on Un*x systems to identify the type of
               a file. It was originally used in binary files to identify the
               file, but the concept was also extended to text files;
               particularly shell scripts; to enable to shell to determine
               which interpreter should be used to execute the contents of a
               file. These magic numbers in text files are really magic "strings"
               and it is these strings that are used by the THE syntax
               highlighting feature to automatically determine the <parser> to be
               used to highlight a file.
     
          message line
               That portion of the screen used to display messages.
     
          prefix area
               That part of the screen display where prefix commands can
               be entered. It also displays the line number of each line
               in the file if <SET NUMBER> is ON.
     
          parser
               A mechanism that translates text strings into identifiable

               A subset of <target>, but only supports targets that are
               relative to the <focus line>, like 3, -5, *.
     
          reserved line
               A line within the <filearea> that contains user text that
               the user can define with the <SET RESERVED> command.
     
          REXX
               A powerful, easy-to-learn macro language available on most
               platforms. THE uses REXX as its macro language.

          string target delimiter
               The character that determines the start and optional ending
               of a <string target>.  A delimiter can consist of one of the
